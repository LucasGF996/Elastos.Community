### 1) The Elastos Blockchain

#### A wholly independent protocol and blockchain that acts as the foundation and root of trust for most of the Elastos ecosystem.

Uses a PoW consensus mechanism based on SHA256, the same algorithm used by Bitcoin (BTC). Blocks are set at ~2 minute block times and 8 MB size limits, compared to BTC at ~10 minutes and 1MB. The result: Elastos mainchain possesses 35-40x the relative performance of BTC.<br/><br/>
As the mainchain only functions as a root of trust, this is sufficient for its purposes. Scalability is intended by its design to derive from the sidechains and superior decentralized models using other services in the Elastos ecosystem.

<b>Mainnet was deployed and live on December 22, 2017</b> and has been running ever since.

<li>
<b>Elastos merge-mining (also called AuxPoW) was launched on August 26, 2018,</b> made possible by sharing the same hashing algorithm as Bitcoin and strategic partnerships with some of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pools.<br/><br/>
This is the exact same merge-mining specification officially recognized by Bitcoin and used by Namecoin. In the context of the official specification, Elastos is considered the auxiliary chain, which gives rise to the consensus algorithm’s name Auxiliary PoW, or AuxPoW for short.<br/><br/>
Through merge-mining, Elastos effectively leverages the hash power of the Bitcoin blockchain, which provides the highest degree of network security available in the blockchain space. Additionally, merge-mining is energy efficient, as it requires no additional computing power to be expended by the mainchain during the merge-mining process.

<li>
<b>As of early 2019, Elastos has amassed over 50% of Bitcoin’s hashrate,</b> which easily solidifies its position as one of the top 5 blockchains in the world by the common cost-to-attack metric. (Calculated as a % of BTC in regards to ranking).
