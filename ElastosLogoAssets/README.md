### Our Guidelines
The Elastos brand is more than just an idea on paper; it is the embodiment of our company, encompassing all of the experiences and expectations that people associate with us. To protect the integrity of the visual and verbal expression of the Elastos brand, it is critical to follow the guidelines outlined.

This comprehensive communication system includes all of the elements you may need—logos, typefaces, colors, and more—to create a consistent tone, look, and feel for Elastos’ communication materials. We invite you to absorb this information and reference it often to become an informed keeper of the brand.
